<h1 class="Title">Table Functions Demo</h1>
<p>The <code><i>DERBY_HOME</i>/demo/programs/vtis</code> directory contains
sample table functions.</p>
<p>This code is now built as part of the standard Derby build.
To build the API documentation, invoke the <code>demodocs</code> target in the
top-level build script.</p>
<p>An <code>.sql</code> script, <code>sql/demoFileVtis.sql</code>, is provided
to test-drive these table functions. Use Derby's <code>ij</code> tool to run
this script. The script needs to be customized as explained in its header.</p>
<p>This script exercises the following table functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PropertyFileVTI</code> - a table function for presenting a property
file as a table</li>
<li><code>ApacheServerLogVTI</code> - an example of an
<code>org.apache.derby.vti.XmlVTI</code> which makes a table out of an Apache
web server log</li>
<li><code>DerbyJiraReportVTI</code> - an example of an
<code>org.apache.derby.vti.XmlVTI</code> which makes a table out of a JIRA
report</li>
<li><code>SubversionLogVTI</code> - a table function for making a table from the
output of the <code>svn log</code> command</li>
</ul>
