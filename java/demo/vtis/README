This branch of the Demo subtree contains sample table functions.

This code is now built as part of the standard Derby build.
To build the javadoc, invoke the demodocs target in the top level
build script.

An sql script (sql/demoFileVtis.sql) is provided to test-drive these table functions.
Use Derby's ij tool to run this script. The script needs to be customized as explained in its
header.

This script exercises the following table functions:

a) PropertyFileVTI - a table function for presenting a property file
as a table.

b) ApacheServerLogVTI - an example of an org.apache.derby.vti.XmlVTI which makes a table
out of an Apache web server log.

c) DerbyJiraReportVTI - an example of an org.apache.derby.vti.XmlVTI which makes a table
out of a JIRA report.

d) SubversionLogVTI - a table function for making a table from the
output of the "svn log" command.
